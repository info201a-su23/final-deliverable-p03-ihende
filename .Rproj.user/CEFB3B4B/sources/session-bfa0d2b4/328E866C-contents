# Introduction

The data we are using for this project was used in The Pudding Essay - How far is too far? An analysis of driving times to abortion clinics in the US. in September 2017. The data set can be accessed here:

[https://github.com/the-pudding/data/blob/master/clinics/cities.csv](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/blob/master/clinics/cities.csv)

With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade and increasing polarization of politics, the topic of abortion has become increasingly controversial. Individual states and/or regions undoubtedly have varying political climates which can affect state regulations and policies on abortion access. It is important to understand the healthcare disparities that are created as a result because they can widen other
socioeconomic gaps. With the provided dataset, we hope to answer the following questions:

1. How does each state vary in the driving times (hours) to the nearest abortion clinic at 12 weeks gestation?
2. How restrictive are individual states when providing abortion access at different stages of pregnancy?
3. ...

This data was collected by Russell Goldenberg and provides us with information on the driving time, in hours, to the nearest abortion clinic in varying locations. This data provides information on hundreds of counties across the U.S. It provides driving times, in hours, to the nearest abortion clinic that will provide abortion care at 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. This type of data can help us detect patterns across various locations regarding how accessible abortion is, making the dataset sufficient in answering our main questions.

However, there are ethical questions and limitations that we need to consider when using this data to answer such critical questions. For example, we must consider who collected this data. Everyone has implicit biases, and the individual identity of the data collectors can affect the methodology of collection and what data is/isn't included. Additionally, we must consider missing or inaccurate values. With an expansive dataset like this one, there are bound to be missing, inaccurate, or distorted values. As a matter of fact, the author of the dataset mentions that they were unable to get detailed timing information for two clinics. Additionally, for city-specific data, only cities with >50,000 population (via 2015 data) were included. When considering this data, these ethical questions and limitations must be considered by us and users of our visuals.
